package mobilePhone;

public class MobilePhone {
	// Please create 4 instance variables for our MobilePhone class:
	// 1.Brand
	// 2.Model
	// 3.Phone Number
	// 4.Storage Capacity
	// Think about what data types would work best with these fields :)


	// Let's create a public constructor for our MobilePhone class
	// Given 4 pieces of information as input (brand, model, operatingSystem, and
	// storageCapacity),
	// Set the instance variables of your object accordingly

	
	
	// Create getter and setter methods for each of our instance variables
	// Please at least write 1 set of getter/setter by hand. After you get the
	// hang of it, you can go to 'source'->'generate getters and setters'->checkmark
	// all of the fields you want
	// getters and setters for->'generate'


	// Lets make a couple custom phone-related methods:

	// 1. A makeCall method that takes a phone number as a parameter and then
	// prints:
	// 'We are calling {the input phone number} from our {brand} {model} phone!'


	
	// 2. An installApp method that takes an app name String as input and then
	// prints:
	// 'Installing {input app name} on our {brand} {model} phone!'


	
	// 3. Lastly, a displayInfo method that takes no parameters and prints all
	// information about
	// the phone:
	// Brand: {brand}
	// Model: {model}
	// Phone Number: {phone number}
	// Storage Capacity: {storage capacity}GB
